2. Can you build a search engine where I can query by business name and
location (expressed as latitude/longitude coordinates) and get the closest
matching businesess from #1 and their associated photos? Example query would
be: [harrods near 51.499446,-0.163636]

Some concepts you may need to learn about:

Geocoding - getting a latitude/longitude coordinate from an address:

Spatial indexing - allows efficient searching for objects in a 2D space. I
believe there is built-in support for this in Lucene and MongoDB.
